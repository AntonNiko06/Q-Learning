# Q-Learning from scratch
Implementation of reinforcement learning agent using Q-Learning for navigating a simple Gridworld / Frozen Lake environment, built without the use of external RL libraries.

## Aim
The aim of this project is to get my foot in the door of reinforcement learning by building a simple project from scratch, without the use of any RL libraries. 

This fits into my broader approach of exploring the field of Machine Learning by first building several models completely from scratch to get an idea of the theory and math underlying them, and then building on that knowledge by creating more complex projects where the aim shifts from implementation and theory to impactful results.

## Features
- Implementation of Q-Learning algorithm from scratch
- Adjustable hyperparameters and maze layout
- Visualization of agent's traversal through maze

## How It Works
The agent moves through the maze either randomly or by performing the action he assigns the highest value to. After each step, the value of performing that action on that field is updated using the Q-Function.
